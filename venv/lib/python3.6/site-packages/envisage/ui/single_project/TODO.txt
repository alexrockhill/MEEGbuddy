To-Do List:

 * Update README and other documentation/examples.
 * Implement a way to publish the ITreeNodeAdapters so that they don't have to
   be in the same file as the class which they adapt.
 * Improve the way we are binding dynamic objects and how they are being
   retrieved.
 * Improve the handling of children in the adapters to remove redudancy.
 * Lots of cleanup left.
