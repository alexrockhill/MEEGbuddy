 Nitime: timeseries analysis for neuroscience data
===================================================

Nitime is library of tools and algorithms for the analysis of time-series data
from neuroscience experiments. It contains a implementation of numerical
algorithms for time-series analysis both in the time and spectral domains, a
set of container objects to represent time-series, and auxiliary objects that
expose a high level interface to the numerical machinery and make common
analysis tasks easy to express with compact and semantically clear code.

Website and mailing list

Current information can always be found at the nitime `website`_. Questions and
comments can be directed to the mailing `list`_.
