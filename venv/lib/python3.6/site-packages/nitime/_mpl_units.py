The classes here provide support for using custom classes with
matplotlib, eg those that do not expose the array interface but know
how to converter themselves to arrays.  It also supoprts classes with
units and units conversion.  Use cases include converters for custom
objects, eg a list of datetime objects, as well as for objects that
are unit aware.  We don't assume any particular units implementation,
rather a units implementation must provide a ConversionInterface, and
the register with the Registry converter dictionary.  For example,
here is a complete implementation which supports plotting with native
datetime objects::


    import matplotlib.units as units
    import matplotlib.dates as dates
    import matplotlib.ticker as ticker
    import datetime

    class DateConverter(units.ConversionInterface):

        @staticmethod
        def convert(value, unit, axis):
            'convert value to a scalar or array'
            return dates.date2num(value)

        @staticmethod
        def axisinfo(unit, axis):
            'return major and minor tick locators and formatters'
            if unit!='date': return None
            majloc = dates.AutoDateLocator()
            majfmt = dates.AutoDateFormatter(majloc)
            return AxisInfo(majloc=majloc,
                            majfmt=majfmt,
                            label='date')

        @staticmethod
        def default_units(x, axis):
            'return the default unit for x or None'
            return 'date'

    # finally we register our object type with a converter
    units.registry[datetime.date] = DateConverter()
